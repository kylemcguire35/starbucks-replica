One of my first projects where I wanted to create a replica of a web page. I liked the look of the Starbucks homepage and created this with HTML, CSS, and JS.
This was my first look at using JS to make a webpage more interactive. The Navigation button in a mobile view works, but most other buttons do not.
This project was made to mimic the Starbucks website on any viewport. Media queries were created to change the design as the screen changes.
